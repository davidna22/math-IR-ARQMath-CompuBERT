Please download the data from the ARQMath Drive (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1YekTVvfmYKZ8I5uiUMbs21G2mKwF9IAm)
<br><br>
The Dataset should be downloaded and named in a folder called data (link above to data). To effectively process that data remove the Version number from the file. For example, *Post.V1.3.xml* should be changed to *Post.xml*.
